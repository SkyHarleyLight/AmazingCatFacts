# Cat Trivia

## Requirements
- On app start, use an API https://alexwohlbruck.github.io/cat-facts/docs/
to get a random cat fact
- Display fact text and its creation date formatted for the current device
locale
- Show a random cat image by using https://cataas.com/cat
- Add button ‘Another fact!’ → load and show a new random fact + image
when pressing it
- Show some kind of loading animation while the fact & image is loading.
- Save the facts that have been displayed so far
- Add a button ‘Fact history’ that navigates to a new screen listing all the
saved facts (show only fact text and creation date, no image necessary)
- Upload your code to the GitHub repository and add the DEMO video of
your working application
## Constraints
- Use Flutter BLoC package for State Management
- Use Retrofit package for API communication
- Use Hive for storing data on the device
## Advices
- Keep the code as clean as possible
- Extract everything that can be considered reusable
- Compose the UI ergonomically
- You should be satisfied with the result. Don’t forget to have fun!
